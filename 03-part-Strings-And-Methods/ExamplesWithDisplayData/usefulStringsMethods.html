      /*Extracting a substring from a string
You can extract a substring from a string using the slice() method. You pass it:
the index at which to start extracting
the index at which to stop extracting. This is exclusive, meaning that the character at this index is 
not included in the extracted substring.*/

      const extractString = "mozilla";
      console.log(extractString.slice(1, 6)); // "ozi"

      //If you know that you want to extract all of the remaining characters in a string after a
      //certain character, you don't have to include the second parameter. Instead, you only
      //need to include the character position from where you want to extract the remaining
      //characters in a string. Try the following:

      console.log(extractString.slice(3));

      //   console.log(extractString.split());

      //Changing case
      //The string methods toLowerCase() and toUpperCase() take a string and convert all
      //the characters to lower- or uppercase, respectively. This can be useful for example
      // if you want to normalize all user-entered data before storing it in a database.

      const radData = "My NaMe Is MuD";
      console.log(radData.toLowerCase());
      console.log(radData.toUpperCase());

      //Updating parts of a string
      //You can replace one substring inside a string with another substring using the replace()
      // method.

      const updateString = "mozilla";
      const updated = browserType.replace("moz", "van");

      console.log(updated);
      console.log(updateString);

      //Note that replace(), like many string methods, doesn't change the string it was called on,
      // but returns a new string. If you want to update the original browserType variable,
      //you would have to do something like this:

      //Also note that we now have to declare browserType using let, not const, because we are reassigning it.
      let returnNewString = "mozilla";
      returnNewString = returnNewString.replace("moz", "van");

      console.log(returnNewString);

      //Be aware that replace() in this form only changes the first occurrence of the
      //substring. If you want to change all occurrences, you can use replaceAll():

      let quote = "To be or not to be"; //be be
      quote = quote.replaceAll("be", "code");

      console.log(quote);
