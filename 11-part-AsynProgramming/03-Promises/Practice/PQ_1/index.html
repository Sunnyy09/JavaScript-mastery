      Write a function, fetchUserData, that simulates fetching data from a
      server using Promises. The function should take a userId as an argument,
      and it should return a Promise that:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Resolves with an object containing the userId and name after 2 seconds.
      </li>
      <li>Rejects with an error message if the userId is not provided.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Use setTimeout to simulate a delay in the data fetch. After creating
      fetchUserData, write code to call this function with both a valid userId
      and a missing userId to see both the resolve and reject cases.
