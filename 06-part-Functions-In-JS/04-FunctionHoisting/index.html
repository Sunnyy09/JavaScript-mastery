    <!-- The function hoisting is a default behaviour in which the function declaration are moved at the top of the
    local scope before execution of the code. So you can call the fucntion in it scope before it is declared itis important
to notived only declaration is hoisted not the initialiation so the variables and the fcntiion shoud have been initialized
before the can be used , similar to the fucntion hoisting the variable hoisting is also default behaviour, the variable 
declaration moved at the top of local scope. we can ue the fucntion bfore it have been declared 
code snippet

add(5,10); // 15
function add(x, y){
   return x + y;
}
--The fucntion add is called as before declaration. This is possible tbecause the interpreter hois the function declation
to the top of the scope.

function add(x, y){
   return x + y;
}
add(5,10); // 15
The fucntion hoisting only works with function declaration not with fucntion expression, sp if te function is defiined 
with fucnion expressions it is not hois at the top.

    <!--<p id = "output"> </p>
   <script>
      printMessage("Top");        
      function printMessage(pos) {
         document.getElementById("output").innerHTML += 
         "The function is called from the " + pos + "<br/>";
      }        
      printMessage("Bottom");
      
   </script>-->
    <!--In the example above, we have defined the printMessage() function, printing the position from where it is called.
 Also, we call the printMessage() function before and after the function definition. It prints the output without any error as
 the function is hoisted at the top of its scope. -->

    <!--<p id="output"> </p>
    <script>
        // test("Top"); // Out of scope
        if (1) {
            test("Top"); // In the same scope
            function test(pos) {
                document.getElementById("output").innerHTML +=
                    "The function is called from the " + pos + "<br/>";
            }
            test("Bottom"); // In the same scope
        }
    </script>-->
    <!--In the example above, we have defined the function inside the 'if' block. 
    So, the function is hoisted at the top of the 'if' block, and you can execute the function only inside the
     'if' block before its initialization. You can't access the function outside the 'if' block.-->

    <!--The hoisting is a very imporatant behaviour in the js , but is always adviceable to declare the function
     or variable set the begin of the code since js always interpreted the code in the sequence if declataion , then initialization, usage.-->
